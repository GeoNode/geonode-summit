aboutUs: "The Summit 2019 brings together the community of users, developers and stakeholders of GeoNode, the popular open source geospatial content management system.
<br/><br/>Join us for a 3-day packed event to learn and contribute to GeoNode!<br/><br/>

GeoNode is a web-based Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) that enables sharing and collaborating on geospatial data. Users can upload existing shapefiles, edit data, and publish finished maps.<br/>GeoNode can also host static documents, such as PDF maps. GeoNode has robust support for open standards and OGC services, which streamlines integration with other systems and existing workflows. For example, data from GeoNode can be easily downloaded as a shapefile for use in ArcMap. At its core, GeoNode is designed to be customizable and extensible.<br/><br/>
GeoNode is used throughout the world by international organizations, non-profits, and mapping agencies for supporting activities ranging from emergency preparedness and response, disaster risk reduction, and many more. Additionally, GeoNode is supported by a rich ecosystem of commercial providers across the world who can help with training, technical support, or development of new features.<br/>
Whether your use case is wrangling thousands of layers or managing just 10 really well, GeoNode can help make your job easier."
