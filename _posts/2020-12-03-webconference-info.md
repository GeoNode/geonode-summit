#### General info

*First things first: If you are registered, you will get your dedicated invitation link 
on friday, 2020.12.04, evening (UTC+1).*

This year's Summit will be hosted by the [Th√ºnen-Institute](https://www.thuenen.de/en/) 
as web conference. We will use Cisco Events as our conference software which will enable
us to split the participants into two groups:

* Attendees
* Panelists (Moderator, Presenter, Host)

To get an overview of Cisco Events you can take a look at the 
[(commercial) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWLvF7O7scc) done by Cisco themselves.
Of course the summit is free of charge and there is no monetization.

#### As attendee

The attendees can follow the presentations and ask questions as part of a dedicated Q&A
chat window. They will not be able to share their own screen. If needed they can be given
permission to talk - e.g. for discussions with the panelists.

You can join with your browser, or a smartphone. The modalities are described in your 
invitation link.

Here is a [short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQSSJYcrgIk&t=1306s) about Cisco Events in 
action as attendee.

#### As presenter (Panelists)

You, as part of the panelists, will be able to share your screen, video and audio and are 
able to answer asked questions. Please do use a headset to prevent us from audio 
feedback during your talk. We will provide the opportunity to do a dry-run beforehand to 
test the software and your hardware. The dry-run is scheduled for friday, 2020.12.04. We 
will discuss timeslots with you in private.
