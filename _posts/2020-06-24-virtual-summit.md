#### GeoNode Summit 2020 will virtual
Due to this years COVID-19 crisis we decided to switch the on-premise summit to a virtual one for 2020. The summit will cover codesprints, talks and workshops as usually but will be hosted as web conference by the original host the Th√ºnen Institue.

We will inform you about new dates as soon as possible.
