##### Arriving By Train
Destination station is Braunschweig Main Station. Travel Information for the German Railroad (Deutsche Bahn) is available here. Continue your trip with a taxi or public transportation (public buses require about 30 minutes). Bus stations are located directly in front of the railway station. Bus line 411 in the direction "Lamme" or 461 in the direction "Lehndorf, PTB". Get off at the "Bundesallee" stop. The bus stop is directly at the entrance of the Thünen campus. Since the campus is very large, either plan for a long walk or have your host pick you up at the main entrance.
