#### GeoNode Summit 2020 will be postponed
We are sorry to inform you that the GeoNode Summit 2020 will be postponed due to current COVID-19 developments. Parts of the community
where unable to attend the summit in germany resulting in very little registration numbers and missing important speakers for the talks.
The already registered persons are informed and the organizers of the event are looking for an alternative date to meet in brunswick later this year.
If you want to discuss with us join the conversation on one of the [available channels](https://docs.geonode.org/en/2.10/about/index.html#get-in-touch-with-the-community). 

We will inform you about new dates as soon as possible.


#### GeoNode online Meetup and Code-Sprint

We will organize an alternative online event like a meetup and code-sprint at the original Summits date. The details are yet to be discussed.
