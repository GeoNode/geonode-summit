#### State of GeoNode 3.0 Free Webinar
GeoNode 3.0 was released about a month ago. See [GeoNode blog](http://geonode.org/blog/2020/05/18/geonode-3-2020/) for complete details. There is usually a presentation GeoSolutions does at the GeoNode summit, but as you know, the [summit was postponed](/blog/summit-postponed/). Therfore they are doing a [free webinar on July 7th at  11:00 Eastern Time](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/5015882501435/WN_05UDiVsnTxW1ASCp37NXUA). You can find more informations at [GeoSolutions blogpost](https://www.geosolutionsgroup.com/news/state-geonode-3-webinar/).

Some highlights of what’s new:

– GeoNode components have been updated to new versions: Python upgrade 3.7, Django upgrade 2.2.12, GeoServer upgrade 2.16.2.

– MapStore is now the default client greatly enriching the experience for viewing the data.

– Greatly improved analytics and getting information about who is visiting the website and their actions. For example, you can see unique visitors who trigger a specific type of event.

– Improved full GeoNode backup & restore.

– Extended GeoNode shared permission via GeoLimits to restrict users or groups to a specific geographical area (see below).

We hope to see you there!
