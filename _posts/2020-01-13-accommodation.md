#### Quota
To make hotel booking easier we have pre-booked a quota of rooms in brunswick. You can find them here [insert link](https://to.somewhere.org).

#### Some information for self-booking
You should pick a hotel in the centre of the city. From there you can easily attend the evening events and use the bus to get to the Th√ºnen Campus - see [Public Transit](https://summit.geonode.org/logistics/). At the campus entrance you will get picked up by our campus shuttle service to bring you to the venue at the Forum.
