#### Quota
To make hotel booking easier we will pre-book a quota of rooms in brunswick, see the [post about pre-booked hotels](/blog/pre-booked-hotels) for more details.

#### Some information for self-booking
If you want to self-book a hotel please choose one in the centre of the city, see [this map](https://www.braunschweig.de/english/touristservice/hotels/map.php). From there you can easily attend the evening events and use the bus to get to the Th√ºnen Campus - see [Public Transit](https://summit.geonode.org/logistics/). At the campus entrance you will get picked up by our campus shuttle service to bring you to the venue at the Forum.
