The Geonode Summit 2019 ended, many ideas have been discussed about the past, the present and future of GeoNode and its community.

Many thanks to participants for coming here in Viareggio and for their interesting presentations.

All those presentations are available [here](https://github.com/GeoNode/geonode-summit/tree/gh-pages/presentation/2019). Take also a look at the [GeoNode Summit 2019 on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=geonodesummit2019) for further contents.

And here some photos of the summit.
