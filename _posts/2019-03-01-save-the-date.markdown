We are pleased to announce that the 2019 GeoNode Summit will be hosted by GeoSolutions from June 11 to 13: save the date!

Join us in Viareggio, Italy, as we bring together GeoNode developers, program managers and users. We will organize workshops, presentations and have an open discussion on the future of the platform.

The final agenda and the schedule will be determined in the following weeks. Stay tuned for more information to come.

We are looking forward to meeting you in Viareggio.
