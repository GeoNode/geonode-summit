We are pleased to announce that the 2018 GeoNode Summit will be hosted by ITHACA from March 26 to 28: save the date!

Join us in Torino, Italy, as we bring together GeoNode developers, program managers and users. We will organize workshops, presentations and have an open discussion on the future of the platform.

The final agenda and the schedule will be determined in the following weeks. Stay tuned for more information to come.

We are looking forward to meeting you in Torino.
