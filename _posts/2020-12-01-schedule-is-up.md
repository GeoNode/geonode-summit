#### The summit schedule is public!

The virtual GeoNode Summit 2020 will be held from December 07 to 09 as web conference. 
With over 110 attendees from all over the world finding a schedule which enabled our 16 speakers to present was not easy but we have done it!

You can find the schedule here: [schedule](/schedule/)

#### Presentations
We decided to give us as community as much time as possible to present the ways GeoNode is currently used 'in the wild' 
 and/or shall be developed further. This lead to nine presentations covering the broad use-cases you can cover by using GeoNode
 in your GIS stack.
 
You can see our speakers here: [speakers](/speakers/)

But this years summit is not only a place to get inspired and to spark discussions, but also to learn!

#### Workshops
Therefore we asked our community what topics they are interested in. Based on our survey we asked experienced community
members if they could lead workshops. We ended up with 6 hours of workshop materials split into
two separate tracks.
