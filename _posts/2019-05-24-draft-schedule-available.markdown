#### GeoNode Summit 2019 - Tentative Agenda Available [here](http://summit.geonode.org/schedule/)

Dear Subscribers,  
a first draft agenda with workshop and presentations have been published today on the [GeoNode Summit 2019 website](http://summit.geonode.org/). Please, have a look and let us know if you have any question.

We have what we think is a very good line up of presentation, all very much focused on our beloved GeoNode. We will discuss about the project status, ongoing projects, future plans and much more.

#### We will see you in Viareggio!
