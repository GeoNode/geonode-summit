  title: "Users Workshop"
  description: "The workshop will cover the following topics: GeoNode from a user perspective, how to. It will cover tipical functionalities and use cases a GeoNode user, either Administrator and Standard, will face. Accounts, users and groups. Resource types handled by GeoNode, how to upload, set permissions, edit metadata and tweak to improve your portal usability. Management of geospatial datasets, diffrent types and how to nicely apply styling to them. Creation of Maps, and share them with the world. Accessing GeoNode from other Desktop and Web GIS applications. As an Administrator, manage the GeoNode data, throubleshoot and fix the most common issues."

  title: "GeoNode with QGIS, GeoNode for DRR"
  description: "Over the last year we have done a number of GeoNode related developments, which relate to integration of GeoNode with QGIS and with using GeoNode for Disaster Risk Reduction. We have also been working to make GeoNode (with QGIS Backend) easily deployable using Rancher and Docker - which we will demonstrate. This presentation will be like a Christmas hamper where we quickly show you the highlights of our work!"

  title: "GeoNode - an additional set of functionalities"
  description: "During this presentation we will review a set of functionalities which we are adding to GeoNode to support use cases such as a resumable upload allowing the batch upload of large resources including File GeoDatabases and imagery tiles, the ability to upload tabular data (e.g. csv, spss, stata, etc.) and turn it into a point layer if it contains latitude and longitude information, the ability to connect to layers hosted on GeoNode from desktop clients such as QGIS or ArcMap, the ability to search place names and navigate geo-spatially to these location on the map, the ability to draw polygons to query any raster to estimate population in given areas for instance, the ability to reference layers between GeoNode instances, the dockerization of the platform and support for S3 for a scalable and affordable production environment, etc."

  title: "Building Flood Models with Geonode"
  description: "I've paired Geonode with the open-source 2d hydrodynamic flood model, ANUGA, to create a collaborative online flood modelling environment. This allows us to move both flood model inputs and outputs into an adaptable, transparent online hydraulic model that gets better with time, as opposed to that PDF version going out-of-date on your hard drive. The mission is to reduce the hassle involved in building and maintaining up-to-date flood models, especially in the years after the original consultancy contract is complete. I'll present a brief demonstration of the application, followed by a technical architecture overview and some lessons learned along the way. "

  title: "GeoNode DevOps with Docker and Rancher"
  description: "GeoNode is an easy to use platform for developing web based Geospatial Information Systems and for deploying interoperable and OGC standards compliant Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI). The platform can be composed and extended with different components like Elasticsearch, GeoGig, QGIS Server beyond the common ones GeoServer, PostGIS and pycsw as an example. This model of a such SDI is natively fitting very well with the cloud approach of Software As a Service (SaaS) and looks at the new DevOps technologies like Ansible and Docker for optimizing the scale up and make an easier deployment for the end users. Docker and its orchestration tool docker-compose has been extensively used to strengthen the configuration and the start of each single component. The talk aims to describe how GeoNode images have been designed and docker volumes are used for data configuration, finally how docker-compose can be used by Rancher stacks. The presentation will provide an introduction to the state of the art and examples on how to deploy GeoNode with Docker for development or to use Rancher for production environments into AWS."

  title: "Adding Raster Analysis Tools to the GeoNode Experience"
  description: "Computers, including mobile devices, continue to become more powerful, opening up pathways for GIS that haven't existed before.  GeoTIFF.io, is an open-source community-driven project, and a website that allows users to analyze rasters completely in their browser.  This presentation will go over a proposed simple addition of a button to GeoNode pages that would allow a user to open up the raster layers in GeoTIFF.io.  GeoTIFF.io, as it processes everything client-side and is hosted on Github Pages, is completely free and can scale nearly infinitely.  Specifically, GeoTIFF.io has been used to analyze pasturelands in Europe, access to ante-natal care in Rwanda, rainfed wheat in Ukraine and much more."

  description: "A data exploration tool for risk related data is under development  by GeoSolutions for the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery global partnership. As part of the Challenge Fund program, this tool aims at providing a centralized, global, database for exposures, hazards and vulnerabilities data sets. 
  The data exploration tool is being developed leveraging on MapStore and GeoNode to provide stakeholders with a user-friendly access to the rich database of information and data useful for risk analysis and disaster management. Such platform will also try to lay out the foundations for GeoNode 3, the new version of the popular Open Source platform."

A gallery of projects and use cases will showcase the versatility and effectiveness of GeoNode, both as a standalone application and as a service component, for building secured geodata catalogs and web mapping services. Lastly, ongoing and future developments will be presented ranging from the upcoming integration with MapStore to the monitoring and analytics dashboard or the support for time series data."

  description: "The first of two design session where we will work together as a community to explore how the current GeoNode experience can be improved for developers as well as for users. Session one will focus on uncovering the problems and obstacles encountered when using and working with GeoNode. We will using a series or fast paced and highly collaborative exercises to identify, arrange and rank issues in preparation for session 2 in the afternoon. To get ready, start thinking of points where changes to GeoNode would make your work easier."
