  description: "Despite enjoying the freedoms of open-source software as a user, many developers may not have
                experience actually contributing to an open source project. As one such user, and possessing no
                prior knowledge of GIS, GeoNode 3 became my first contribution to an open-source platform, let
                alone an open-source geospatial platform. My involvement includes the upgrade from the Python 2-
                based application to the present-day version and continues to this day with full PostGIS integration
                right around the corner. This talk will focus on my journey to becoming a free and open-source
                software developer, the challenges I encountered and opportunities I was given. I will share my
                perspective on becoming a FOSS developer on an international project while working remotely
                from my home in New Zealand. In doing so, I aim to highlight and discuss my ideas to make open-
                source technologies more accessible for future contributors."

  place: "Virtual Summit Room"
  description: "As the project sponsor of the funding program for the expansion of Gigabit Internet on behalf of the Federal
                Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure, the atene KOM GmbH has to manage hundreds of funding
                applications of communes in Germany. One requirement of the funding application is a network plan,
                containing multiple layers of the broadband network in the region of the funding applicant.
                We use GeoNode to manage the datasets and provide preconfigured maps to our colleagues which are in
                charge of checking the individual network plans. During the years our GeoNode Stack was filled up with
                more than 30000 layers in over 2300 maps. In the presentation, I will focus on the workflow of the
                automatic import and configuration of the layers and maps as well as address challenges we have to deal
                with the growing number of datasets.
                In addition to the internal use of GeoNode, we host multiple GeoNode instances for external customers,
                also in the field of broadband expansion. Here, we developed custom features which will be shown in the
                presentation."

  title: "pygeoapi: a possible future GeoNode backend?"
  place: "Virtual Summit Room"
  description: "The proliferation of REST [1] as an architectural style as well as OpenAPI [2] has resulted in broader adoption of a leaner service contract and the OGC developing a
                new generation of API specifications in support of discovery, access, visualization and processing of geospatial data [3]. These efforts are aimed to lower the barrier
                to implementation, especially for mass-market/non-geospatial developers.

                pygeoapi [4] is an OGC Reference Implementation compliant with the OGC API - Features specification. Implemented in Python, pygeoapi supports many other OGC
                APIs via the Flask web framework and a fully integrated OpenAPI structure. Lightweight, easy to deploy and cloud-ready, pygeoapi's architecture facilitates publishing
                datasets and processes from multiple sources. Implementations of other OGC APIs are in progress for the 1.0 roadmap, including gridded/coverage data (OGC API -
                Coverages), search (OGC API - Records), and vector/map tiles (OGC API - Tiles). pygeoapi is a community project of the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo).

                pygeoapi follows a clear separation structure with a view, provider/plugin and entry point module. The view approach allows for easy integration with other Python
                web frameworks like Starlette and Django. The provider abstracts connectivity to numerous data sources (CSV, SQLite3, GeoJSON, Elasticsearch, GDAL/OGR) and
                provides extensibility to support additional formats, databases, object storage and more.
                This presentation will provide an overview of pygeoapi, roadmap and possibilities for GeoNode integration.

  place: "Virtual Summit Room"
  description: "Recent developments in the field of research data infrastructures (RDIs) have shown that
                efficient management of geodata for researchers and their projects becomes increasingly
                important. Besides the storage, discovery and presentation of classic geodata (raster, vector),
                additional data types will come into focus. While GeoNode is already suitable for managing
                aforementioned classic geodata, an integration of (near real-time) sensor and time series
                datasets (e.g. air quality, agriculture,water management, traffic,) can provide benefits for
                researchers, data scientists as well as the GeoNode software landscape. In this short
                presentation we outline a possible integration of OGC-compliant 52°North Open Source
                software solutions (i.e. OGC Sensor Observation Service and SensorThings API). Besides a
                short technological demonstration of existing software components, we conceptualize initial
                ideas on possible integration patterns as well as key interfaces for a successful realization."

  description: "In this presentation, I will begin with background on the concept of crowdsourced
                georeferencing—a strategy used by many historical map archives to enhance their digital collections.
                By supporting map georeferencing in a browser-based platform, the labor-intensive process of
                transforming each scan in a large institutional collection can be distributed among interested members
                of the public. For my current masters degree research, I am using GeoNode as the basis for my own
                contribution to this field. By creating an extension on GeoNode that provides a georeferencing
                interface, users will be able to turn Documents (scanned historical maps) into Layers
                (GeoTIFFs/WMS). I will share details about my technical strategies and progress thus far. I see great
                potential for a fully open source and modern tech stack like GeoNode (and its constituent parts) to not
                only support crowdsourced georeferencing, but also build small “georeferencing communities” through
                user interaction and collaboration."

  place: "Virtual Summit Room"
  description: "The GEMex was a 3 year and half project on a cooperation in Geothermal energy research between
                Europe-Mexico for development of two different geothermal areas in a complementary effort of a European
                consortium with a corresponding consortium from Mexico.The GEMex project focused on these three pillars
                on both areas: i) resource assessment, ii) Reservoir characterization and iii) concept development.
                Geothermal data, in the form of maps, datasets and models were organized and collected in an open access
                 database and made available in a spatial data infrastructure according to international standards and
                 protocols.The GeoNode Open Source Geospatial Content Management System was chosen as web-based
                 application to deploy the GEMex spatial data infrastructure. To this aim, beside the GeoNode system
                 installation and configuration initially at the version2.4, a procedure to prepare the datasets and
                 the metadata was defined to facilitate and speed-up the datasets uploading. In order to maximize the
                 discovery effectiveness, some specific categories were created on the platform as geology,
                 geochemistry, geophysics, modelling because related to the main produced datasets. At the end of the
                 project, more than 120 different datasets were stored as layers into the GeoNode platform (migrated to
                 the 3.1 version) and 15 maps were created to combine different layer by study area or theme. The
                 geological and geophysical cross-section vector layers were even prepared embedding in their attribute
                 table the URL of the cross-section images, which they could be accessed directly by click on the
                 getFeatureInfo box. Researchers belonging to the project consortium took the advantage of this kind of
                 tool to easily share and get needed datasets for their research activity but even Mexican SME
                 interested in geothermal business has used and are using the Open Access Database. This contribution
                 can be classified as case study and it is aimed to describe how GeoNode was used for a
                 EU Geothermal project."

On the other, this software suite allows for advanced, customizable, and semantics-aware metadata management (via the EDI editor developed by CNR - IREA).
#These components enable communities interoperable management of in-situ sensor and geographic data through standards-based metadata and services (e.g., OGC, INSPIRE). Initially developed for the marine domain, GET-IT has been customized for the environmental, geological, urban planning, and precision agriculture contexts. In this presentation, the architectural and technological choices underlying this GeoNode Project will be showcased."
