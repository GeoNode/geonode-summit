  bio: "I’ve been a designer for more than 15 years. I started in visual communication but have spent most of that time creating digital products and services, along with the concepts and strategies that support them. I’ve done this for large organisations, non-profits, and start-ups in many different sectors: humanitarian, health, employment, government, retail and advertising. I’ve worked on and led teams of all sizes and shapes, alongside everyone from members of the public to members of the board. I know how it important an inquisitive, collaborative approach to design is. And I believe that the same skills and methods that go into making a good, fit-for-market product can be applied to solving the complex, socially-focussed problems facing us today."
