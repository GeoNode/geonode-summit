I’ve worked on and led teams of all sizes and shapes, alongside everyone from members of the public to members of the board. I know how it important an inquisitive, collaborative approach to design is. And I believe that the same skills and methods that go into making a good, fit-for-market product can be applied to solving the complex, socially-focussed problems facing us today."
